随缘更新
A quick way to create a simple react project

It's a tool for developers who are familiar with Webpack or want to learn Webpack

## quick start

1. Download this tool

   ```nginx
   npm i create-simple-react-app -g
   ```

2. Create and into a dir

   ```nginx
   mkdir demo-project && cd demo-project
   ```

3. Input commands to init a project

   ```nginx
   create-simple-react
   
   #or
   create-simple-react-app
   
   #or
   csra
   ```

4. Make the choices you like



## problems

1. You can't choose redux and react-router-dom before version 1.2.0
2. There is no tests in any templates
3. There may be problems when using static resources
4. I am still a rookie using Webpack, I am sorry for the bad experience you have when using this tool. If you have any problems or and ideas to imporve, welcome to join me
